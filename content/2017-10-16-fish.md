Summary: Aliases in fish shell


Why fish? Because it has sensible defaults and the out of the box experience
is just great.

Aliases are just functions!
To define a function use `alias rmi "rm -i"`

To save the functions use `funcsave rmi`

To list all functions use `functions`

To show function definition use `functions rmi`
