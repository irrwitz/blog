Changing the running user of a systemd service stopped working. There were some
lession to be learned:

1. pip default install location is under %HOME%, so all installed libs needs
 to be installed again

2. db connection failed with
  ```shell
  cx_Oracle.DatabaseError: DPI-1047: Oracle Client library cannot be loaded: libclntsh.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or director
  ```

   The previous user had in the .bashrc this snippet
 `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/lib`
 Adding this to the new users .bashrc didn't help. Finally the solution was to
 create a file under `/etc/ld.so.conf.d` called `oracle.conf` with the single
 entry `/usr/lib/oracle/12.1/client64/lib`. A `sudo ldconfig` and sudo `ldconfig -v`
 verified that the shared libs are accessible. So db connection was up and
 running again.
