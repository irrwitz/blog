title: ELM mixing HTML
---

To have elm code inside of HTML you need to escape it

```haskell
import Html exposing (li, text, ul)
import Html.Attributes exposing (class)

fruits = ["apples"
         , "oranges"
         , "ananas"
         ]

main =
  ul [class "fruits-list"]
    (List.map (\fruit -> li [] [text fruit]) fruits)
```
